Tcl'@c:year@ - Speaker instructions
Hi @mg:name@

Please take the opportunity to check your laptop works with the
conference video projector no later than the day before your
presentation.  You can ask any of the conference organisers to help
with this.

Please make yourself known to the session coordinator in the
presentation room during the break prior to your session. The
coordinator will ensure that all laptops for the following session are
configured and ready to go.

You will have 20 minutes to present your paper, followed by a short
period for questions and discussion with the audience.

You will be given a 5 minute and 1 minute warning when your 20 minutes
are about to finish.

See you in @h:city@,
